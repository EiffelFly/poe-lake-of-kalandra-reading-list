# The reason I create this list

Path of Exile 3.19 - Lake of Kalandra is a tough league for both players and the Grinding Gear Games. But I think no matter what the direction of this game goes, these issues had inspired lots of good discussion around lots of stuff and we need to document it down before it gets flooded by other content.

# General principles about the list

- Constructive and informative opinion.
- Be polite and respect everyone.
- Truth to be told.
